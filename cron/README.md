You can call the `report.sh` either manually or via a cron job.  Here is a suggested example of a cron job in the 
file `report_cron_job`. In this particular example, `report.sh` is run every 6 hours. See this 
[website](https://crontab.guru/) for more information.

To use the example file, just execute `crontab report_cron_job` on your command line
